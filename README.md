# mapty
A web app for recording your workouts. All credit goes to my teacher Jonas Schmedtmann.
Just click on the map and a form will appear on the side for you to fill in with details about your workout. After you fill in the data, a marker will appear on the
map and your exercise will be displayed as a list on the side. You can click on it and you will be redirected to your workout on the map. The workouts are stored in
the local storage so they persist when you refresh the page.
